                            opened its doors in 1967 and swiftly solidified its reputation as a
                            leader of Korea’s food industry. LOTTE Wellfood Co. Ltd. enjoys
                            leadership status in gums, candies, biscuits, chocolates and ice
                            cream in Korea. Juicy Fresh, Spearmint, Freshmint chewing gums and
                            Ghana Chocolates have served as long-time favorites for over four
                            decades. Xylitol chewing gum continues to grow strong since its
                            launch - thanks to its ability to reduce risk of tooth decay. To
                            this end, it has been adding new business lines in the domestic
                            market, growing existing business while actively participating in
                            the overseas markets.</p>
